## Background

I began my studies for the Harvard Professional Certificate in Data Science
in April 2020 during the height of the coronavirus pandemic. My original plan
was to undertake data science studies as part of my masters, but the extra time
I had as a result of the health crisis allowed me to aim at completing Harvard's
standalone professional certification in Data Science.

My current goal is to complete the program by July 2021 in conjunction with my
graduation from the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science with Master's
in ICT in Business & the Public Sector.

## Theory and exercise solutions log

During the duration of the program I am logging the key learning points and my
solutions to exercises for each course. These are available below:
